## Program Use and Output

### Use four fenced code blocks to provide usage and output from four different runs of `palindromechecker` with different inputs

TODO: For each of the four outputs below, be sure to also provide what you
typed into the command-line for your use of the `palindromechecker` program

- Recursive:
  - Input a `word` that is a palindrome
  - Input a `word` that is not a palindrome

- Reverse:
  - Input a `word` that is a palindrome
  - Input a `word` that is not a palindrome

### What is the output from running the test suite with test coverage monitoring? How good are your tests?

TODO: Provide the command that you used to run the coverage tracking for the test suite
TODO: Make sure that you explain the quality of your tests as explained by the coverage report
TODO: While you are not required to achieve `100%` coverage of the program under test,
      you are encouraged to achieve as high of test coverage as you can.
TODO: Depending on your implementation, it should be possible to achieve `100%`
      code coverage of the functions in the three program modules!
